Quick, on-the-go adjustments for images that load in an inconvenient orientation.

Enable Developer Mode by toggling it on in the upper-right corner of the page.

Using the Extension
Open the extension from the Chrome toolbar.
Enter the desired rotation angle (e.g., -90 for counter-clockwise or 180 for upside-down).

All images on the current page will rotate based on the specified angle.
